 # There are four operator in python 
 
 # Arthematic Operator  # Comparision/Relation Operator  --- Assignment Operator  --- Logical Operator 


# Arthematic Operator ( + , -, /, *, **, %) -----------

# a = 5
# b = 6
# sum = a + b
# print(sum)

# sub = a - b
# print(sub)

# mul = a * b
# print(sub)

# div = a / b 
# print(div)

# rem = a % b
# print(rem)


# pow = a ** b
# print(pow)


# Comparision Operator( ==, !+, <, >, <=, >=) ---------------------------

# a = 10 
# b = 30 
# print( a ==b)   Equall to

# print(a != b)  Not Equal to

# print(a > b)  Greater 

# print(a < b)   Lower

# print(a <= b)    Lower or equal 

# print(a >= b)    Greater than equal 



# Assignment Operator(=, =+, -=, *=, /=, **=)-----------------------------

# 


# Logical Operator ( Not , OR, ANd) --------------------------------


# a = 5
# b = 7
